# Client-Server StringWeightingInFile
This project implements a client-server solution in Python for processing strings according to certain defined rules.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

During installation, be sure to check the option "Add Python 3.X to PATH" (3.X is the version of Python you are installing).

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 

git clone https://github.com/jmartinezrdev/StringWeightingInFile.git

2. Create a virtual environment:
Open a terminal or command line in the folder where you cloned the project, and execute the following command to create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows: 
venv\Scripts\activate

- Linux and macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install dependencies:
There are no external dependencies for this project as it uses only Python's standard libraries.

5. Run the server:
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, and execute the following command to start the server:

python server.py

6. Run the client:
In another terminal or command prompt, navigate to the same directory and execute the following command to start the client:

python client.py

7. Use the menu:
The client will display a menu where you can select the "Start process" option to begin processing the strings. You can choose whether to define the number of strings to generate or use the default value of one million. You can also select "Exit" to close the application.
